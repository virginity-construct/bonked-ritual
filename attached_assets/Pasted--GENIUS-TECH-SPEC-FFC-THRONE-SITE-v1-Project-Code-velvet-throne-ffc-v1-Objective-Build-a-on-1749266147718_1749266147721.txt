🧠 GENIUS TECH SPEC — FFC // THRONE SITE v1
Project Code: velvet-throne-ffc-v1
Objective: Build a one-page, ritual-themed, dark-mode membership site for FFC (Frequent Fuck Club), a $25/month private circle for returning escort clients.
Purpose: Frame FFC not as a subscription, but as an initiation into a secret society. The tone must seduce, not sell.

CTA Button:
[Claim Your Legacy – $25/month] → triggers modal or links to Stripe

Background: Deep black with subtle animated crest or sigil (optional SVG watermark)

2. The Code (How It Works – Reimagined)
Minimalist 3-step structure (with custom icons or styled numerals):

Initiate: Join FFC. The first whisper of access.

Anticipate: Receive discreet alerts—new girls, hidden windows.

Revel: Privileges unfold. No further permission required.

3. The Unspoken Privileges (Perks – Mythified)
Grid or card layout:

Priority Enrolment

Concealed Chambers (unlisted availabilities)

The Sixth-Month Rite (exclusive merch drop)

Invites to the Veiled (hidden events)

Whispers from the Oracle (AI-crafted filth, optional)

4. The Ledger (FAQs – Rewritten as Creed)
“Must I engage monthly?” → “Your standing remains. The allure endures.”

“Is withdrawal permitted?” → “At your discretion. The door is never truly closed.”

5. The Oath (Footer)
Line: “Sanctuary of discretion. Sovereignty of choice. Beyond judgment, only reward.”

Optional: Crest favicon, copyright
