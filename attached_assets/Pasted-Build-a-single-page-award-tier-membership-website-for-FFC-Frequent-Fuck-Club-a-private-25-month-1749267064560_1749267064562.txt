Build a single-page, award-tier membership website for FFC (Frequent Fuck Club), a private $25/month male-only circle for discreet access to premium adult experiences. The site must feel like luxury Web2, while stealth-integrating a Solana wallet layer and NFT logic without mentioning crypto at all.

Target user: men aged 25–55, high-income, privacy-focused, erotically curious but time-poor.

Purpose: Frame FFC as an elite access club, not a subscription. The user must feel chosen, not sold. No wallet jargon. No crypto buzzwords. All tech is hidden beneath seduction.

Tone: secret society meets dark luxury SaaS. Think: RitualOS x Apple x Eyes Wide Shut.

Design:
- Responsive dark mode layout
- Playfair Display (headers), Inter (body)
- Tailwind CSS
- Color palette:
  --ffc-black: #0b0b0f
  --ffc-blood: #8b1e3f
  --ffc-velvet: #5e3d75
- Subtle microinteractions on hover (glow, icon pulse, modal fade)
- Custom cursor class: `.cursor-sigil` that activates on CTAs
- Favicon: minimalist serpent or keyhole crest

Page Sections:

1. **Hero – The Threshold**
   - Headline: "You Didn’t Ask. You Were Chosen."
   - Sub: "FFC is not a membership. It's a rite. $25/month unlocks access."
   - CTA: [Begin Initiation]
   - Background FX: subtle dark sigil animation (SVG loop or Lottie)

2. **The Code**
   - 3 steps:
     1. Initiate – Join privately via Stripe
     2. Anticipate – Get discreet alerts, hidden offers
     3. Revel – Privileges deepen the longer you stay
   - Stylized geometric icon set

3. **Unspoken Privileges**
   - Grid of benefits (tier-unlocked, no hard labels):
     - Early access windows
     - Unlisted encounters
     - Erotic Oracle (custom AI scenes)
     - Sixth-Month Rite (gift drop)
     - Inner Veil Invites
     - [Hidden: NFT quietly minted at Tier 2]

4. **The Ledger (FAQ)**
   - “Is this a subscription?” → "You’re not paying for access. You’re paying to never wait again."
   - “Do I need crypto?” → “Nothing technical required. All tools are built for silence.”

5. **The Oath (Footer)**
   - Text: “Beyond judgment. Only reward.”

Integrations:
- Stripe checkout: 4 product tiers (Initiate, Herald, Oracle, Shadow Key)
- Helius API: silent NFT mint post-tier upgrade (no UI)
- Magic.link: email-based wallet binding if user opts in (silent fallback)
- SendGrid: erotic AI content flow (Oracle+)
- Printful: month 6 merch dispatch
- Supabase or Airtable backend for user-tier logic
- JS Exit-Intent modal with randomized quotes:
  [
    "Most men consume. FFC exists for the few who reciprocate.",
    "You’ve seen the veil. It won’t wait long.",
    "Access is vanishing. This window won’t open again."
  ]

Output all files:
- `index.html`
- `style.css`
- `modal.js`
- `wallet.js` (stealth bind + mint logic)
- `stripe.js` (tier handler)
- Provide full Stripe product ID placeholder references
- Compress into deploy-ready package

This site must feel custom-coded by a ritualist who dated UX itself. It must whisper to the user, not shout. It must win awards while hiding the engine.
